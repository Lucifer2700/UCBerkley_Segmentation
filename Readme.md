## Introduction

Road segmentation is a critical task in computer vision for autonomous driving. This project demonstrates the implementation of a CNN-based road segmentation model that takes input images and predicts pixel-wise road and non-road classes.

## Dataset

We used the UC Berkeley BDD 100K dataset for training and evaluation. It contains labeled images with pixel-level annotations for road regions. The dataset includes a variety of scenarios, lighting conditions, and road types.

## Model Architecture

Our road segmentation model is built using a U-Net architecture, which has proven effective for image segmentation tasks. The architecture consists of an encoder that captures image features and a decoder that produces the segmentation mask. The model is trained end-to-end on the dataset.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lucifer2700/UCBerkley_Segmentation.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Train the model:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

5. Run the road segmentation on your own images:

   ```python
   python predict.py --input input_image.jpg --output segmented_image.jpg
   ```

## Results

Our trained model achieves an accuracy of over 95% on the test dataset. The road segmentation output demonstrates accurate identification of road regions in various environments.

Here are some example results:
